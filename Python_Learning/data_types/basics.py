In Python you don't have to worry about data types.
but there are types which can be very useful:
complex
long(only in python2)
bytes and bytearrays
tuple (similar to lists but they are immutable, can't change the values)
set ad frozenset (similar to lists, but only have unique objects)
set([2, 1, 3, 2)] -> (1, 2, 3)
